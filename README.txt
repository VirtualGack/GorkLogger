First python Project

Concept is a lightweight note app that will allow me to enter a contacts name when they call, fill a textbox with notes from the call and  submit them as a timestamped entry into a .txt that will be created and named based on the date.

I've been learning fundementals from 'learn python the hard way' as well as searching online and playing around with scripts, far from a pro and any constructive feedback is appreciated.

A tool developed for streamlined my call answer process with work.

1. add the dist folder to a directory you will remember and open the application.
2. fill the box next to 'Caller ->' with the name of the caller.
3. fill any notes from the call in the large text box.
4. press the 'end call' button to save the time stamp, caller ID and notes to a text file in the set directory named after the current date.
