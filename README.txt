First python Project

Concept is a lightweight note app that will allow me to enter a contacts name when they call, fill a textbox with notes from the call and  submit them as a timestamped entry into a .txt that will be created and named based on the date.

I've been learning fundementals from 'learn python the hard way' as well as searching online and playing around with scripts, far from a pro and any constructive feedback is appreciated.
